# Nmap
nmap is a software used for network and port scanning. the following "guide" provides cheatsheets for using nmap

## Basic network scanning
to perform a basic network scanning we can use 
```nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/${TARGET} $TARGET```
* -sC performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to --script=default.
* -sV probe open ports to determine service/version info

NSE scripts define a list of categories they belong to. Currently defined categories are *auth, broadcast, brute, default. discovery, dos, exploit, external, fuzzer, intrusive, malware, safe, version, and vuln*. Category names are not case sensitive.

to locate script by categories, we can use
```locate -r '\.nse$' | xargs grep categories```
