# JWT
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
We can use cURL to authenticate via JWT to a service with following commands:
```TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{"username":"{username}","password":"{password}","rememberMe":false}' https://{hostname}/api/authenticate | jq -r '.token')```
And use the token to authenticate
```curl -H 'Accept: application/json' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" https://{hostname}/api/myresource ```
